We'll create a etcd cluster with 3 node(coreos) to provides etcd service
for other worker nodes(coreos).

We do not use discovery from discovery.etcd.io because that will make
our coreos slug, so we start a single etcd in local host. This is the
single point of failure I think, so we'll later configure each etcd
node to discover peer themselves.
